**Chicago Crime between 2017 to 2022**

The Chicago Crime data set is a very robust data set beginning in 2003-2023(rolling but dated to the date of the report.) The unfiltered data set is quite large nearing 8 million records across 22 variables.

[*"Feb. 11, 2020: Illinois becomes first state to test for new coronavirus" -Chicago Tribune*]{.underline}

[*"Feb. 28, 2022: Mask mandates end in most of Chicago and Illinois"-Chicago Tribune*]{.underline}

My hypothesis is that the climate of world events, job insecurity, lock downs, and state of distress from covid-19 had a direct impact and increase on crime beginning in 2020 through to the 2022 during the pandemic.

I will utilize the count of the crime instead of the general per-capita measurement due to the restrictions in the data. However, the census for Chicago shows a \~3% decrease in population in the Chicago area during the available 2020-2022 census.gov records. This would mean any INCREASE in crime would be even more significant. But for the sake of simplicity I will treat the population as a static and non variable during my analysis.

**My Hypothesis:**

H0: Covid lockdowns had no significant effect on crime during the years of shutdown 2020-2022

H1: There was a significant increase in crime during the years of shutdown 2020-2022

**Import Library**

```{r}
library('tidyverse')
library('janitor')
```

```{r}
df = read.csv('C:/Users/Logan/Downloads/Chi_Crime.csv')
```

**Clean Column Headers**

```{r}
df <- df %>% clean_names()

```

**Variables I will drop and why.**

\>Case Number, FBI CODE,BEAT CODE,IUCR: Not Important ID data for me.

*location,x,y coords,block,District(police dist not ward), Community ID:*

I will be focusing on by WARD and ideally some long lat.

updated on : not an important column for the analysis

```{r}
names(df)
```

```{r}
head(df)
df <- df %>% select(id,date,primary_type,description,location_description,arrest,domestic,ward,year,latitude,longitude)
```

I have a goal to plot crime on the map so I will remove nulls from these values they are a very small subset of the data. I also want to grab the years leading right before Covid-19 and onwards.

```{r}
df <-  df %>% filter(!is.na(latitude),!is.na(longitude),(year>2016 & year<2023))

```

Convert to Logical for arrest and domestic

```{r}
df <- transform(df, arrest = as.logical(arrest),
          domestic = as.logical(domestic),
          date = as.POSIXct(date, format = "%m/%d/%Y %I:%M:%S %p"))
```

```{r}
df <- df%>%
      mutate(year_month=format(date, "%Y-%m"))
```

Final check for any Nulls, Looks Good

```{r}
names(df)
```

```{r}
ndf <- df%>%
  group_by(year_month,primary_type,ward)%>%
  dplyr::summarise(
    crime_count=n(),
    was_arrested_count=sum(arrest, na.rm = TRUE),
    was_domestic_count=sum(domestic, na.rm = TRUE)
    )

ndf
```

Store my cleaned data frames for ease of access later.

```{r}
write.csv(df, "C:/Users/Logan/Documents/GitHub/high_crime_chi_crime/2017-2022_Crime.csv", row.names=FALSE)
```

```{r}
write.csv(ndf, "C:/Users/Logan/Documents/GitHub/high_crime_chi_crime/2017-2022_Agg_Crime.csv", row.names=FALSE)
```

**Explore and Visualize the data:**

```{r}
df = read.csv("C:/Users/lmpro/Documents/GitHub/high_crime_chi_crime/2017-2022_Agg_Crime.csv")
df
```

```{r}
df <- df%>% transform(df,
                year_month=str_replace(year_month,'-','\\.'))


```

```{r}
df <- df%>% transform(df,
                year_month=as.numeric(year_month))
df <- df%>% filter(year_month != "NA")
df
```

```{r}
sdf <-  df%>%
  group_by(year_month)%>%
  dplyr::summarise(
    crime_count=n(),
    )

sdf


```

```{r}
ggplot(sdf)+
  geom_line(mapping=aes(year_month,crime_count))+
  ylim(775,975)
```

```{r}
cor(df$year_month,df$crime_count)
```

This is not at all what I expected to see in terms of crime over time had a negative effect on crime levels. However, recall we identified the numbers were not per-capita and that there was around a 3% decrease in total population in the Chicago Area during the pandemic, which is strikingly similar to the negative 3% correlation we see. Without further analysis it would be incredibly safe to assume we cannot attribute rising crime levels to covid since the data can not even support the claim of crimes even changing in any significant manner. After doing additional visualizations in excel per the requirements of the capstone we can see the following interesting finds. in the data.

**Crime by Category in Pre Post Covid Introduction to Chicago:**

**Arrest per Crime in Pre-Post Covid Introduction to Chicago:**

**Percent of Crime that was Domestic in Pre-Post Covid Introduction to Chicago:**
